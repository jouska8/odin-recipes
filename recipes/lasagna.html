        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagne is a traditional Italian dish consisting of wide,

            It typically includes alternating layers of pasta, meat sauce 
            (such as Bolognese), béchamel (a creamy white sauce), and cheese, 
            particularly ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. The dish is baked
